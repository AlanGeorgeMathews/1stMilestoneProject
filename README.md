# Basic Lawn Care



Welcome to the README file for my  HTML/CSS Project website. I have just recently renovated my home,and after that I had to fix the back yard that was compacted my construction machinery. The ongoing process of the lawn renovation has been the inspiration for this project theme.

 Existing Features

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Aeration and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

- __The Sign Up Page__

  - This page will allow the user to get signed up to recieve useful lawn tips. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address.  They are also asked what the biggest problem with their lawn is, so as they can be provided with relevant tips.


### Features Left to Implement

I would to implement a before and after gallery page of lawns that have been renovated, and more how to tips and videos on the aeration page

## Testing 

I tested the website for responsive design as I went along using dev tools on chrome to see it on different screen sizes. Although I tested and tweaked, i believe that I could further refine this with more time available.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator]
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator]

### Unfixed Bugs

I need to work on the flexbox parameters in my CSS.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
